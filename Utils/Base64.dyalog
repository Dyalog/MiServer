  ⍝d How does base64 work? The purpose of the base64 algorithm is to
  ⍝d convert all 256 characters of the character set into the 64 characters
  ⍝d shown below, as those characters are common on all possible machines
  ⍝d through wich a mail message can pass on it's way through the Internet.
  ⍝d To do this, every 24 bits (3 8-bit characters) are split into 4 6-bit
  ⍝d chunks (=24 bits again). Those 6-bit chunks are used as an index into
  ⍝d the base64 alfabet. If the message does not contain a number of
  ⍝d characters divisible by 3, "=" characters are appended as padding after
  ⍝d encoding, to help the decoding function do it's work.
