This is MiServer's default configuration settings.
These settings can be overridden in each site's Config folder.


Access.xml sets the access of specific folders for specific groups.


Datasources.xml lists the resources needed. It is not detailed in the general configuration folder. If needed it should reside in the site Config folder.


Logger.xml specifies where to log any message.


Resources.xml describes the resources available. In general the JQuery suite of tools is made available by default. It doesn't hurt to have them there even if not used. Each <name> should describe where resources are found, like script files.
The path given for a resource should be pointing to a physical location, like somewhere on the hard disk. If the first part of the location refers to a virtual location, as found in the "Virtual.xml" file, the that first part is replaced by whatever path is given there.
For example, in the "Resources.xml" file the resource <name> JQuery may be found in <script> /JQ/jquery.js. The first part of this path is 'JQ'. If there is an entry <directory><alias> for 'JQ' in the file "Virtual.xml" then its <path> is used instead of /JQ. If there are no entries in "Virtual.xml" for 'JQ' then the path /JQ/jqury.js is taken as is.
Several resources may use the same virtual entry. This allows for relocating quickly a resource by mkaing the change in only one place, the "Virtual.xml" file.


Server.xml is where you define what your site: its name, address, port, default page, etc.
<logger> specifies the namespace in your code to handle logging. If none is specified a general logger namespace (named LumberJack) will handle it.
<TrapErrors> will crash and stop if set to 0. This is useful when debugging.


Users.xml lists the user names, passwords and groups they belong to. Access.xml lists the site paths (not physical paths) each group is allowed to access.


Virtual.xml maps resources to a specific path. See Resource.xml above for details.
