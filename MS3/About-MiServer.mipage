    ⍝  MiServer is a free, open-source web server implemented in Dyalog APL.
    ⍝  It enables the APL user to build sophisticated websites with little to no
    ⍝  knowledge of the underlying web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc).

    ⍝  This website serves as guide to MiServer 3.0 – providing documentation, samples,
    ⍝  and advice. At the same time, it showcases many of MiServer's capabilities,
    ⍝  as it is built almost entirely in APL using components available in MiServer.

    ⍝  Unfold the branches of the  <strong>Getting Started</strong> tree at the top left
    ⍝  to find documentation and some small demonstration applications. The
    ⍝  <strong>Controls</strong> tree contains lists of all the controls or widgets that
    ⍝  are built-in to MiServer 3.0, with examples of use.

    ⍝  <strong>Tip:</strong> Some of the samples will be a little cramped when displayed in line
    ⍝  on this page. Look for the "pop out" link to view a sample
    ⍝  in a tab of its own.
    ⍝  When a sample is popped out into its own tab or window, the source
    ⍝  code and page content can be toggled by clicking the large Dyalog&nbsp;
