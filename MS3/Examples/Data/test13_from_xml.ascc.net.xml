        <name id="中">Chinese Test #13: Big5</name>
        <data>This file collects the previous tests cases into a single file.
        It is suitable for a quick overview.
        </data>
        <data>The XML header of this file is
        &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="Big5" standalone="yes" ?&gt;.
        </data>
        <data char="The character is here: [&#20013;]."
        >The character is here as decimal NCR: [&#20013;].
        It is the Chinese character for middle.
        It should look like a box with a vertical
        line through its middle. 
        </data>
        <data char="The character is here: [&#x4E2D;]."
        >The character is here as hexadecimal NCR: [&#x4E2D;].
        It is the Chinese character for middle.
        It should look like a box with a vertical
        line through its middle. 
        </data>
        <data char="The character is here: [中]."
        >The direct character is here: [中].
        It is the Chinese character for middle.
        It should look like a box with a vertical
        line through its middle.

        <data char="The character is here: [究]."
        >The other direct character is here: [究]. If it looks like the umlaut mark followed by "s", 
        then something like 8859-1 encoding is being used.
        </data>
        <data refid="中">Here is a test of a CDATA marked section. 
        <![CDATA[CDATA section is here: [&#x4E2D;].]]>
        The program should not convert these into a Chinese character.
        It should not convert the ampersand into an entity reference
        either.
        </data> 
        <data>And here are three embedded elements using a Chinese character
        name: <中 /><中 /><中 /></data>
