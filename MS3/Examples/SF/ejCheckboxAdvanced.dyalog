:Class ejCheckBoxAdvanced : MiPageSample
⍝ Control:: _SF.ejCheckbox
⍝ Description:: Use callback to toggle checkboxes and whether they allow the indeterminate value 

⍝ This example shows how to use the SyncFusion CheckBox widget

⍝ Three series of checkboxes are displayed in a table. They can all be ticked.
⍝ The first one of each line is tristate, that is it can be in one of three states.
⍝ It is ticked if all the boxes to its right are ticked, it is unticked if all the ones to its
⍝ right are not ticked and it is shown as a square if there is a mixture of ticked and unticked
⍝ to its right.
⍝ Furthermore, if it is clicked it turns ON or OFF the boxes to its right to match its own state.
⍝ Finally, a single box on a fourth row is used to turn ON/OFF all the boxes on top of it.
⍝ It is also tristate and will show if all the boxes above are all ON or all OFF or mixed. 

⍝ To specify that a check box is checked we set the option 'checked' to TRUE using a 1.
⍝ To specify that a check box can be in 3 states we set the 'enableTriState' option to TRUE.
⍝ When a box is tristate the option 'checkState' is used to specify which of the 3 states it is in:
⍝ Check, Uncheck or Indeterminate. Note that if the 'checked' option of a tristate box is also 
⍝ set to TRUE it will display as ticked even if the option 'checkState' is set to Uncheck.
